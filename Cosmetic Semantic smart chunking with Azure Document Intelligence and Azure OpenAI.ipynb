The annual performance towards the\\ngoals is linked to the compensation system for executives to\\nencourage their active participation in the efforts to achieve\\nthem. Furthermore, every year, production sites set targets\\nfor the \\'Environmental Operations Index\\' and monitor their\\nperformance every month. This performance has been linked\\nto the KPIs of related executives and employees to further\\nstrengthen the execution of environmental performance\\nmanagement.\\n\\n\\n## Environmental Investment and Education\\n\\nAmorepacific Group conducts environmental investments\\nto operate a smooth environmental management system\\nand achieve environmental goals. In 2022, environmental\\ninvestment and operation costs totaled 4.55 billion KRW for the\\nAmorepacific Group and 4.5 billion KRW for Amorepacific. In\\naddition, prior to making new investments, environmental risks\\nare reviewed in advance based on the safety and environmental\\nchecklist. Matters related to environmental regulations\\ncompliance, and safety and health are checked alongside the\\nchecklist, and new investments are made only for cases verified\\nby the teams in charge of safety and environment.\\n\\nAmorepacific Group provides in-house environmental education\\non plastics, environmental labeling/advertisements, climate\\nchange, and chemical substances to raise the level of awareness\\nregarding eco-friendly management among all employees. In\\nparticular, the Subcommittee on Environment and Energy is\\nconducting training for environmental practitioners in addition\\nto the compulsory legal education. We strive to enhance the\\ncapabilities of the working-level staff in charge of environmental\\nmanagement, through education on policies and trends\\nrelated to the environment & energy, management of pollution\\nprevention facilities, and practical training on building energy\\nconservation. In 2022, we reviewed legal operations through on-\\nsite visits to all domestic production sites and conducted training\\non environmental policy trends and legal implementation. As a\\nresult, there were no significant environmental violations and no\\nfines for environmental violations in 2022.\\n\\n\\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Number of Participants in</td>\\n<td>Environmental Education Hours</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Environmental Education</td>\\n<td>(Based on data for</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>(Based on data for Amorepacific Group)</td>\\n<td>Amorepacific Group)</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>2,967 Total employees</td>\\n<td>Total 7,40 / hour</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>\\n\\n\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Chapter 1 Chapter 2\" -->\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Chapter 3.

In particular, we\\nwill respond actively to climate change by expanding\\nthe use of renewable energy in product manufacturing\\nprocesses and reducing GHG emissions from the entire\\nprocess of corporate activities, including supply chains.\\n\\nMeasures for Responding to Climate\\nChange\\n\\nAmorepacific has established a climate change strategy to\\nrealize carbon neutrality based on its eco-friendly beauty\\nleadership spanning over 30 years. The two pillars of\\nAmorepacific\\'s climate change strategy for achieving carbon\\nneutrality are process innovation, and product innovation.\\n\\nThrough process innovation, Amorepacific seeks to minimize\\nclimate impact across all the processes of the compnay,\\nproduction, logistics, and suppliers. First of all, we will primarily\\nfocus on the production part of the entire product lifecycle\\nfrom production to disposal, to convert the electricity used\\ninto renewable energy. By 2025, Amorepacific\\'s headquarters,\\nR&I Center, stores, and sales offices will use 100% renewable\\nenergy to minimize the climate impact of the entire process.\\n\\nThrough product innovation, we will reduce GHG emissions\\nat the product level and lay the foundations for various\\nstakeholders to work together on climate crisis. We will reduce\\nour products\\' environmental footprint by reducing GHG\\nemissions throughout the entire process, from raw material\\nproduction, product usage, to product disposal.

To this end, we have established a 2030 Carbon\\nNeutrality Roadmap in consultation with the industry,\\nacademic experts and top management. Amorepacific will\\nreduce 100% of Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 compared\\nto 2018 emissions. In 2022, Amorepacific increased the share\\nof renewable electricity used at all workplaces up to 34.1% and\\nincreased energy efficiency at production sites, reducing GHG\\nemissions by 42.7% compared to 2018. By 2022, eight of the\\ndomestic vehicles were converted to electric vehicles, and five\\nrapid chargers have been installed to continue the eco-friendly,\\ncarbon neutral transition.\\n\\n\\n## Conversion to Renewable Energy\\n\\nAmorepacific was the first in the South Korean beauty industry\\nto have joined RE100, a global renewable energy campaign.\\nRecognizing the importance of expanding renewable energy\\nto overcome the climate change crisis, we are making various\\nattempts to utilize the newly revised domestic renewable\\nenergy policy with the aim of achieving RE100 early, in 2025.\\nIn 2022, we were the first in South Korea to sign a direct\\nPPA for renewable energy, with SK E&S. Through this, it is\\nexpected that Daejeon Daily Beauty production site will receive\\n5MW of renewable energy for 20 years from the first half of\\n2023, reducing GHG emissions by about 2,700 tons per year.\\nAdditionally, in 2022, Amorepacific signed a third-party PPA\\nwith Korea Electric Power Corp. and Eco-Network. Amore\\nBeauty Park, which produces major Amorepacific products\\nsuch as Sulwhasoo and LANEIGE, has already secured its own\\n2.6MW solar power infrastructure, and it has been able to\\nproduce products using 100% renewable power from 2022\\ndue to the supply of renewable power through green premium\\nand third-party PPA. Furthermore, in 2022, Amorepacific\\nsigned South Korea\\'s first-ever renewable energy virtual power\\npurchase agreement (VPPA) with SK E&S and Bukchon Seomo\\nWind Power, and will receive 3MW of renewable energy for\\nabout 20 years.\\n\\nIn addition, Amorepacific\\'s business sites are making various\\nefforts to independently produce renewable energy. Since\\n2021, 100% of the electricity used in Shanghai Beauty\\nproduction site is from renewable energy. Also, solar power\\ngeneration facilities the size of 1.6MW have been installed in\\nAmore Beauty Park in Osan, Daily Beauty production site in\\nDaejeon, and Beauty production site in Shanghai. Currently,\\nAmorepacific generates and uses its own renewable energy\\nfrom the 4.3MW solar power plant installed. Along with the\\nadditional renewable energy secured through VPPA, we were\\nable to convert 34.1% of the company\\'s electricity used in 2022\\ninto renewable electricity.\\n\\n\\n## Ensuring Energy Efficiency in Production Sites\\n\\nOsan Amore Beauty Park has been carrying out various\\nactivities to reduce energy consumption and increase the\\nproportion of renewable energy usage. First, we reduced our\\ntotal energy use through enhancement of energy efficiency\\nand conservation activities. Also, we are expanding in-house\\npower generation facilities to produce our own renewable\\nenergy as much as possible, even though this requires cost\\ninvestment and maintenance efforts. In 2022, 4% of the total\\nelectricity used at production sites was obtained from solar\\npower generation, and we plan to expand our own power\\ngeneration facilities in the future. In addition, Osan Amore\\nBeauty Park achieved RE100 in 2022 through the purchase of\\ngreen premium plan and the signing of PPA.\\n\\nFurthermore, we have combined innovation in the facility\\noperation process and electricity conservation activities in\\nour daily work life to reduce overall energy consumption. We\\nestablished a system to control the ventilator, which operated\\n24 hours a day, regardless of facility operation. Additionally,\\nwe improved our facilities to reduce power consumption\\nwhile bettermenting funtions to prevent air pollutants being\\nreleased into the air, and these measures were selected as\\na best practice by the Ministry of Environment. Electricity\\nconsumption was reduced by changing the thermal or heating\\nsystem of the production facility, and activities for continuous\\nenergy savings were identified and implemented through\\nelectricity conservation initiatives and energy task force (TF)\\nactivities. Representatively, Osan Amore Beauty Park reduced\\nthe annual gas (Scope 1) usage by 72,519m3, and electric\\n(Scope 2) usage by 812,276kW by applying motor inverters,\\ncontrolling temperatures for heating and cooling systems,\\nimproving lighting control efficiency, and upgrading facility\\nfunctions.\\n\\n\\n## Transition to Low Carbon Logistics\\n\\nAmorepacific also aims to minimize GHG emissions in areas\\nof direct and indirect activities involved in product delivery.\\nTo this end, we have now adopted eight electric vehicles and\\noperate five rapid chargers. We are continually converting\\nlogistics center vehicles into eco-friendly vehicles, and plan\\nto convert all related distribution vehicles into eco-friendly\\nvehicles by 2030.\\n\\nPercentage of eco-friendly vehicles owned\\n(Based on separate data for Amorepacific)\\n7.9 %\\n\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"n E Chapter 1 Chapter 2\" -->\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Chapter 3.

The building is designed to consume\\n37.6% less energy than the projected energy demand.\\n\\nIn addition, Amorepacific is expanding the use of renewable\\nenergy, including solar power generation facilities installation\\nin idle spaces at its headquarters and production sites to\\nincrease renewable energy generation following the RE100\\ndeclaration. Solar panels are installed and operating in\\nAmorepacific headquarters, Osan Amore Beauty Park, and\\nInnisfree Jeju House. In the case of Amorepacific headquarters\\nbuilding, about 4.2 TJ of renewable energy, including solar and\\ngeothermal energy, is produced and used in-house. China\\'s\\nShanghai Beauty production plant installed solar power\\ngeneration facilities to achieve carbon neutrality with 100%\\nrenewable energy in 2021, and also remained carbon neutral\\nin 2022. Until now, we have installed solar power generation\\nfacilities with 4.3MW capacity by utilizing idle spaces at various\\ndomestic and international workplaces.\\n\\nIn particular, Osan Amore Beauty Park is a space that receives\\nattention for its eco-friendly design. Osan Amore Beauty Park\\nhas already secured its own power generation infrastructure\\nof about 2.6MW by installing solar modules on the roof of the\\nlogistics building, and is designed to use energy efficiently to\\ncurb GHG emissions. It is equipped with a heat shrink system\\nusing late-night electricity to store cold water late at night and\\nthen use it for cooling during the day. It is also designed to\\nmaximize natural lighting and reduce electricity usage through\\nAI lighting. Rainwater storage and purification facilities are\\ninstalled to reuse more than 6,000 tons of rainwater annually\\nfor landscaping and washing work clothes, and further the\\namount that accounts for 30% of the total water required for\\nthe entire production process is recycled.\\n\\n\\n<figure>\\n\\nAMOREPACIFIC\\n\\n</figure>\\n\\nSolar Power Generators Installed on the Roof of Osan Amore Beauty Park\\n\\n\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Chapter 1 Chapter 2\" -->\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Chapter 3.

We evaluate\\nclimate risks and opportunities systematically, reflect\\nfactors that have a large impact on the company in\\nour management strategy, and strive to respond\\nproactively to risks by establishing appropriate\\ncountermeasures.\\n\\n\\n## Climate Risk and Opportunity Management System\\n\\nClimate Governance\\n\\nClimate risks and opportunities are managed and supervised\\nby the ESG Committee under the Board of Directors.\\nSpecifically, reports and decisions on climate strategies, action\\nplans, and implementation performance are made by the ESG\\nCommittee every quarter. In 2022, internal and external trends\\nrelated to climate change, and investment plans and outcomes\\nfor reducing GHG and driving RE100 were discussed at the\\nESG Committee meetings. The Sustainability Committee,\\ncomposed of top management, works with the ESG Committee\\nto make strategic decisions on climate agendas and monitor\\nthe implementation of tasks to address key challenges.\\n\\n\\n### Climate Risk and Opportunity Management Process\\n\\nAmorepacific Group periodically identifies risks and\\nopportunities that are highly associated with the company\\'s\\nbusiness, and evaluates the level of impact of the identified\\nfactors to select significant risks and opportunities. We also\\nuse climate-related scenarios to analyze the impact of climate\\nrisks and opportunities over time and reflect the findings in our\\nbusiness strategy.\\n\\nThis climate risk management process is integrated into the\\nEnterprise Risk Management process.

We also want to\\nidentify opportunity factors, reflect them in management strategies and activities, and thereby realize new growth engines. According to\\nthe TCFD recommendations, climate risks were divided into transition risks and physical risks, and risks and opportunities that are highly\\nrelevant to the company\\'s business were identified.\\n\\n\\n<table>\\n<caption>Key Climate-related Risks and Opportunities Factors</caption>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Category</th>\\n<th colspan=\"2\">Climate-related Risks</th>\\n<th>Climate-related Opportunities</th>\\n<th>Emerging Financial Impact</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Transition Risk</td>\\n<td>Regulations</td>\\n<td>- Strengthened reporting obligations for GHG emissions - Increased product export risks and compliance costs due to stricter regulations on packaging materials and waste management globally</td>\\n<td>The Group\\'s exclusion from GHG management regulations in accordance with the 2030 carbon neutrality goals for production sites.

Through the evaluation, potential\\nfactors that have a significant impact on the overall business\\nare selected among various risk and opportunity factors, and\\nmeasures are established and implemented by the relevant\\ndepartments to respond effectively to the factors.\\n\\nThe assessment found that the most significant of the physical\\nrisks were power outages due to extreme weather conditions\\nand facility outages due to disruptions in the heating and\\ncooling systems. Damage to the facility is expected to increase\\nthe cost of repair. It is also expected that among the transition\\nrisks, we have a high chance of facing risks related to the\\ncarbon border tax. In particular, Amorepacific Group exports\\nits products to various overseas countries in Asia, Europe, and\\nNorth America, so price competitiveness may deteriorate due\\nto increased production and export costs when the carbon\\nborder tax is applied.\\n\\nAccording to the analysis, the significant opportunity\\nfactors were the creation of new market value through the\\ndevelopment of eco-friendly products and services, and the\\nreduction of mid- to long-term production costs due to the\\nefficient use of energy/water. Amorepacific Group may gain\\nmarket leadership by providing customers with sustainable\\nconsumption opportunities in line with changes in consumers\\'\\neco-friendly preferences, and implementing differentiation\\nstrategies. Furthermore, expanding the use of renewable\\nenergy offers an opportunity to minimize the cost exposure\\nfrom increasing fossil fuel prices and carbon taxes.\\n\\n\\n## STEP 3: Analyze Climate-related Scenarios\\n\\nThrough climate-related scenario analysis, Amorepacific\\nGroup identified the future climate risk level in detail. IPCC\\nRCP Representative Concentration Pathways(RCP) 4.5 and RCP\\n8.5 scenarios were used to assess physical risks, and IEA SDS\\nscenarios were used to assess transition risk and opportunity\\nfactors.\\n\\nScenario analysis confirmed that for physical risks, the risk\\nof plant closures due to large-scale flooding, water resource\\nrisks, and increased precipitation will be the most significant\\nfactors. Based on the evaluation results, a response strategy\\nwas established to minimize their impact throughout the entire\\nbusiness process. Specifically, we are expanding the use of\\nrainwater in our workplaces, conducting regular facility safety\\ninspections with regards to weather changes, and increasing\\nthe efficiency of energy use by expanding the use of renewable\\nenergy.\\n\\nSince the cosmetics industry has less energy consumption and\\ncarbon dioxide emissions than other industries, the possibilities\\nof transition risks such as carbon taxes and energy costs are\\nless compared to other industrial sectors. However, if carbon\\ndioxide is released at the current rate, operations of the\\nAmorepacific Group are expected to cause much more carbon\\ndioxide emissions by 2030. Since carbon dioxide reduction\\nactivities are essential to achieve the carbon reduction target\\nset by Amorepacific Group for 2030, we have established a\\nresponse strategy to achieve the reduction targets. We will\\nactively pursue the development of new technologies to reduce\\nScope 1 emissions and expand the installation of renewable\\npower facilities and purchase of renewable electricity to reduce\\nScope 2 emissions.\\n\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n<!-- PageNumber=\"40\" -->\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Chapter 1\" -->\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Chapter 2\" -->\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Chapter 3.

Material Safety\\nData Sheets (MSDS) for chemicals are managed in an integrated\\nmanner through the AP-CHEMS system. We established a\\ndatabase of all the different types of materials (raw materials,\\nreagents, MRO, etc.) with the information on substances subject\\nto work analysis, controlled substances, hazardous substances,\\nand substances subject to special inspections, with regards\\nto occupational safey and health. Through this database, we\\nconduce systematic health management activities. In addition,\\nwe are conducting regulatory review and establishing a database\\nfor new chemicals.\\n\\n\\n### Management of Air and Soil Pollutants\\n\\nAmorepacific Group monitors the emission status and conducts\\nregular facility inspections to manage and reduce air pollutants\\nefficiently. Amore Beauty Park, in particular, obtained the\\nMinistry of Environment\\'s integrated environmental permit\\nfor the first time in the beauty industry in 2021, and manages\\nfacilities for each category of environmental pollutant emission\\nsuch as air, soil, and water by integrating the permits. Air\\npollutant discharge is prevented by automatically controlling\\nthe damper of the local exhaust system within the air emission\\nfacility through the control of the fan inverter in the air pollution\\nprevention facility. Also, a system for monitoring the operation\\nof the air pollution prevention facility is established to control\\nthe operation status of the facility in real-time. As a result, air\\npollutants are discharged at a level that is about 20% lower\\nthan the legal emission allowance. In addition, to preserve\\nsoil environment, soil contamination near the workplace is\\n\\nperiodically measured in consultation with external experts.\\nMeasurement results are reported to the Subcommittee\\nof Environment, which is attended by company-wide\\nenvironmental personnel, and monitored regularly.\\n\\n\\n#### Water Resource Management\\n\\nAmorepacific Group has established the 3R principles of \\'Reduce\\'\\nto improve the efficiency of water use, \\'Recycle\\' to expand\\nwater recycling, and \\'Reuse\\' to expand water reuse, for efficient\\nmanagement of water resources. In particular, the in-house\\nstandards for the management of water pollutants are managed\\nat a level that is about 30% stricter than legal acceptance\\nstandards. Wastewater treatment is managed based on\\nstrengthened internal standards, which includes measuring not\\nonly specific water hazardous substances such as copper, lead,\\nand mercury, but also other potential substances of concern.\\nRainwater is collected and used as recycled water through\\n3,000-ton storage facility, and in 2022, the use of recycled\\nwater was expanded to include landscaping, car wash services,\\ncooling water for refrigeration units, and air conditioning. We\\nalso established an infrastructure to reuse the final treated water\\nas landscaping water, reducing water usage and finding its\\nadditional uses. We have established a system to monitor water\\nwithdrawal automatically in Amore Beauty Park, and installed\\na groundwater pump inverter to reduce groundwater usage\\nin OSULLOC Farm, so that groundwater could be withdrawn\\nefficiently according to the weather forecast. Also, we are in the\\nprocess of designing and constructing a rainwater usage system\\n(Siphonic roof drainage) in the new OSULLOC farm in Jeju.\\n\\n\\n### Wastewater Management\\n\\nAmorepacific Group has implemented a monitoring system\\nthat allows centralized control of all processes for thorough\\nmanagement of wastewater. Real-time measurements of Total\\nOrganic Carbon (TOC) are being monitored. In addition, the\\nunderwater stirring method was changed from the existing air\\n\\nblowing method to the horizontal vortex generation stirring\\nmethod to implement efficient treatment of pollutants. We\\nmanage the wastewater discharge processes that are subject to\\nenvironmental impact assessment, by registering them in the\\nmajor environmental impact registration system.\\n\\n\\n## Conservation of Biodiversity\\n\\nPreserving biodiversity is closely tied to the company\\'s business,\\nas a significant portion of Amorepacific\\'s raw materials comes\\nfrom plant resources. We established a separate strategy to\\nuse biological resources and preserve biodiversity in a more\\nsustainable way, and in 2022, invested about 2.32 billion KRW in\\nbiodiversity conservation and their sustainable use. Amorepacific\\nreviews and reflects international standards such as those set\\nby the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in\\nits raw material management system to examine whether the\\nnew raw materials violate the standards, before selecting them\\nto be used. We are also actively building a biodiversity research\\nnetwork. We are conducting joint research with National\\nInstitute of Biological Resources and Baekdudaegan National\\nArboretum to find the hidden value of indigenous plant resources\\non the Korean Peninsula. Furthermore, we are continuously\\ncarrying out biodiversity preservation activities to protect the\\nenvironment in the vicinity of the production sites. A leading\\nexample is our participation in the improvement of Osancheon\\nEcological Stream in Osan, Gyeonggi-do, where Amore Beauty\\nPark is located, since 2016. As a result of environmental recovery\\nactivities, such as creation of a wetland ecological garden, and\\ninstallation of ecological education facilities, the water quality\\nof Osancheon Stream, which had deteriorated to level 5 (very\\nbad), was improved to level 2 (good), and even otters, a first-\\nclass endangered wildlife, have been discovered in Osancheon\\nStream.\\n\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"n E Chapter 1 Chapter 2\" -->\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Chapter 3.

All facilities, such as Amore Beauty Park and Daily Beauty\\nproduction site, are diagnosing compliance with environmental\\nregulations in all areas including air, water quality, waste, and\\nchemical substances. The responsible department periodically\\nchecks major environmental law and regulatory amendments,\\nincluding domestic law, international law, international\\nagreements, and regulations, for management and shares\\nthem with related departments. In addition, we review licenses\\nand standards accord ing to the revision of the law and make\\nchanges if necessary.\\n\\n\\n### Waste Management\\n\\nAmorepacific Group is carrying out more efficient recycling\\nfor each business site by dividing the waste generated in a\\ndetailed manner, into different substances and types. We\\ndeveloped our own environmental operation index in order\\nto manage our targets set for reducing waste emissions and\\nmanaging recycling rates. To increase the actual recycling\\nrate, we continue to identify excellent recycling companies and\\nconduct on-site inspections of our waste disposal companies.\\nIn addition, through the production and transmission of\\nvarious campaign videos, we are educating employees on\\nproper separation, discharge, and waste reduction activities.\\nRegular training is conducted not only for employees but also\\nfor related suppliers to raise awareness on how to classify\\nwaste properly and manage waste warehouses.\\n\\nAchieved Zero Waste-to-Landfill from Production\\nSites\\n\\nAs part of Amorepacific\\'s third promise in \\'2030 A MORE\\nBeautiful Promise,\\' the company achieved its mid- to long-term\\n\\ngoal of \\'Zero-Waste-to-landfill generated at global production\\nsites by 2030\\' ahead of time in the first half of 2023. In 2021,\\nabout 97% out of a total of 3,096 tons of waste generated\\nfrom Osan Beauty Park was recycled, and the remainder was\\ndisposed of by incineration and direct reclamation. In 2021, we\\nfound a way to successfully recycle 3.5 tons of dust from dust\\ncollectors, which was one type of waste sent off to landfill, and\\nso from 2022, we managed to achieve zero-waste-to-landfill at\\nall our production sites at home and abroad.\\n\\nFurthermore, following Osan Amore Beauty Park, both\\nDaejeon Daily Beauty production site and COSVISON\\nproduction site have obtained an international verification of\\nZero-Waste-to-Landfill (ZWTL). The Zero-Waste-to-Landfill\\nVerification evaluates the recycling level of waste generated at\\na business site and grades it according to the rate of recycling.\\n\\nAmore Beauty Park achieved over 94% circular resource\\nutilization, becoming the first in the beauty industry to\\nobtain the silver level certification from ZWTL international\\nverification, in March 2022. Waste generated at Amore\\nBeauty Park is transferred to a 543m\\' waste recycling center,\\nclassified into 21 types, and recycled by 12 resource circulation\\nmethods. Since 2021, more than half of the dust waste, which\\nwas previously sent off to the landfill, has been recycled as a\\nmaterial for basic construction of road works such as asphalt.\\nIn addition, in the first half of 2023, Daejeon Daily Beauty\\nproduction site and COSVISON production site received the\\nPlatinum rating, the highest rating available, in recognition\\nfor 100% recycling rate without incinerating or reclaiming the\\ngenerated waste. As we achieved our goal of direct reclamation\\nahead of time, we are developing plans to further advance\\nwaste management, and are implementing the recycling of\\npreviously non-recycled, reclaimed waste.\\n\\n\\n<figure>\\n\\nAMOREPACIFIC\\n\\n</figure>\\n\\n\\nAmore Beauty Park Acquires the Zero-Waste-to-Landfill International Verification\\n\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n<!-- PageNumber=\"n E\" -->\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Chapter 1 Chapter 2\" -->\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Chapter 3.

In particular, Amore Store, located in Amorepacific\\nheadquarters, operates empty bottle collection program on an\\nongoing basis to raise employees\\' environmental awareness\\nand encourage voluntary participation in environmental\\nmanagement. About 120 tons of empty bottles were collected\\nin 2022, and a cumulative 2,473 tons of empty bottles have\\nbeen collected as a result of the empty bottle collection\\nactivities since 2009. Amorepacific Group promises to take\\nthe lead in solving the plastic problem through systematic\\nrecycling of plastic bottles.\\n\\n\\n## Usage of Plastic Packaging1)\\n\\n\\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th rowspan=\"2\">Category</th>\\n<th rowspan=\"2\"></th>\\n<th>Unit</th>\\n<th>Plastic</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>packaging materials</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td rowspan=\"3\">Percentage of recycled content within plastic packaging2)</td>\\n<td>Percentage out of total</td>\\n<td>%</td>\\n<td>6.6</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>plastic packaging by weight</td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>2022 Goal</td>\\n<td>%</td>\\n<td>5.0</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Total weight of plastic packaging</td>\\n<td>Total weight</td>\\n<td>Ton</td>\\n<td>12,640</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>2022 Goal</td>\\n<td>Ton</td>\\n<td>12,000</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>\\n\\n\\n1\\\\) The weight of packaging materials is aggregated based on the Extended\\nProducer Responsibility (EPR) for 2022\\n\\n2\\\\) The percentage of recycled content within plastic packaging materials is\\ncalculated including the recycled plastic purchased from outside\\n\\n\\n## [Case] GREENCYCLE Campaign\\n\\n\\n### Signing of an Agreement on the Use of Recycled Materials from Empty Cosmetic Bottles\\n\\nIn April 2022, we signed an MOU with Hyundai Engineering &\\nConstruction for the use of materials generated from recycling\\nempty plastic cosmetic bottles. Accordingly, Amorepacific\\nwill provide active cooperation to recycle our empty cosmetic\\nbottles and use the recycled materials for construction\\nmaterials and design development. The empty plastic bottles\\nwill be shredded and combined with ultra-high performance\\nconcrete (UHPC), to be reborn into construction terrazo tiles,\\nto be used in apartment compounds and landscaping facilities.\\n\\n\\n<figure>\\n</figure>\\n\\nUpcycled Tea House\\n\\n\\n### Recreated Empty Bottles - Upcycled Objet\\n\\nThe Creative Partners (CP) program is run by Amorepacific\\'s\\nCreative Center for its members. The program let\\'s the\\nmembers propose and implement a variety of new business-\\nrelated ideas for collaboration. In 2022, a member\\'s idea of\\n\\'Upcycled Objet\\' was embodied and developed into a real\\nproject. Amorepacific worked on this project with artist Park\\nSun-min, a glass craft artist, to solve the one-off empty glass\\nbottle resources that have been used. We thought up of ways\\n\\nto stay longer with consumers by creating infinite use of our\\nproducts. We converted our used, and thrown away glass\\ncosmetic containers, which were previously utilized as a plastic\\nsubstitute, into objects with infinite purpose. Amorepacific\\nplaces high emphasis on zero waste solutions that increase\\nproduct recyclability, and promote reuse, not only during\\nproduction process but also during disposal through methods\\nsuch as recreating waste glass bottles into works of art. As\\na result, we aim to convey the essence and new value of\\nenvironmental packaging materials to society.\\n\\n\\n<figure>\\n\\nSulwhasoo\\n\\nSubvhaşr\\n\\nBLOOMSTAN\\n\"\\n\\n</figure>\\n\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Upcycled Objet\" -->\\n\\n\\n### Environmental Campaigns with the Participation of Employees\\n\\n\\n#### Carbon Empathy Campaign\\n\\nThrough an idea contest, we received suggestions from\\nour employees on how to save energy and resources in our\\ndaily life. As one of the suggested campaigns, we carried out\\n\\'Digital Carbon Diet\\' campaign, which involved measures\\nsuch as turning off unused digital devices, and we encouraged\\nvoluntary actions from employees to protect the environment.\\n\\n\\n#### Zero-Food Waste Campaign\\n\\nWe conducted a campaign to reduce food waste at each of our\\nbusiness site. Specifically, we motivated employees not to leave\\nfood waste through the Zero-Food Waste Campaign, where\\nwe presented stickers to the employee when they showed up\\nwith clean food tray at the exit after eating at the canteen. As\\na result, COSVISION and Daily Beauty production sites reduced\\nthe generation of food waste by 35% on average compared to\\nthe same month from the year before.\\n\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3.

We\\nrun various programs in relation to job roles and leadership\\nperspectives for leader candidates and existing leaders based on\\nthe leadership pipelines. For leaders ranging from team leaders\\nto executives, we are focusing on providing content-centered\\neducation programs [AP Sikam (Amorepacific Knowledge and\\nSense), Leaders Forum, etc.] that enable them to develop job\\ninsights, and on leadership coaching courses where they receive\\nsupport on providing coaching and feedback as a leader.\\n\\nWe also conduct leadership diagnostics once a year for\\ncompany leaders. We diagnose leadership capabilities through\\na leadership coaching center with the help of in-house coaches\\nand then run feedback sessions with the leaders. In particular,\\nnew leader candidates are provided with separate organizational\\nfeedback for onboarding, discussing ways to create synergy\\nbetween subordinate leaders and their individual leadership\\nstyles, and providing 1:1 coaching and in-house mentoring if\\nnecessary. For more than 200 leader candidates at home and\\nabroad, we run a process to enable them to understand and\\ndevelop leadership proactively.\\n\\nFurthermore, a discussion-style curriculum is run to help leaders\\nunderstand customer-centric perspectives and brand-centric\\nmanagement, to enhance their understanding of the scheme\\nand strategy and to discuss effective ways to achieve the goals.\\nSemiannual discussion programs are operated to strengthen\\ndiscussion skills between managers and C-Levels. In addition,\\nwe focus on enhancing leaders\\' job expertise by identifying the\\ncompetencies essential to achieving the strategy every year and\\nrunning the \\'The School\\' course. In 2022, we shared in-depth\\nconcerns about brand-specific growth and rebranding strategies\\nthrough the \\'Marketing School\\'.\\n\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n<!-- PageNumber=\"n E\" -->\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Chapter 1 Chapter 2\" -->\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Chapter 3.

Amorepacific and all of its subsidiaries comply with\\nlabor laws and conduct voluntary self-inspection of working\\nconditions at least once a year. As of the end of 2022, there\\nwere 2,006 Amorepacific labor union members, with 67.5% of\\neligible employees (2,974 employees) actively participating in\\nthe labor union.\\n\\nEmployees of Amorepacific are free to join and leave the labor\\nunion at their own will. Collective agreements that apply to\\nall employees are signed every other year. The Labor Council\\nholds meetings each quarter, and this serves as a forum to\\ndiscuss employee welfare enhancement, grievance handling,\\nand safety management, among other significant labor-\\nrelated issues. In addition, various ad-hoc communication\\nchannels such as management briefings, business plan\\nsharing, and union member meetings are operated to facilitate\\ncommunication and engagement. Amorepacific\\'s labor-\\nmanagement cooperation team and human resources team\\nare checking and supporting the establishment of a win-win\\nand cooperative labor-management relationship.\\n\\n\\n## Employee Wellbeing\\n\\n\\n### Strengthening Support for Maternal Protection\\n\\nAmorepacific ensure the health and safety of pregnant\\nfemale employees by complying with legal requirements\\nsuch as shortening working hours, adjusting commute times,\\nallowing time for prenatal check-ups, and prohibiting overtime\\nwork to create a conducive and safe working environment.\\nFurthermore, we operate a system that guarantees a\\nreasonable level of monthly salary when employees do not\\nwork due to maternity leave and parental leave. If the subsidy\\nprovided by public agency is less than the monthly salary\\nfor the last 30 days of maternity leave, which is an unpaid\\nperiod under the law, the monthly salary is compensated by\\npaying the difference.

Through human rights policies,\\nwe ensure that the human rights of various stakeholders, such\\nas employees, customers, local communities and suppliers, are\\nrespected throughout the Group\\'s management activities, and\\nstrive to prevent acts of collusion or facilitation of human rights\\nabuses. In addition, Supplier Sustainability Guidelines specify\\nwhat suppliers must comply with in order to prevent human\\nrights violations.\\n\\nStatement of Human Rights Policy[7\\n\\n\\n#### Human Rights Training for Employees\\n\\nWe internally train all of our employees on preventing sexual\\nharassment at workplace and improving understanding of\\ndisabilities. Through such human rights trainings, we thrive to\\nprevent sexual harassment at the workplace, spread the value\\nof coexistence, and improve perceptions regarding disabled co-\\nworkers. Regular online trainings were conducted in 2022, and\\nadditional trainings were provided for the new employees and\\nthose who did not receive training.\\n\\n\\n#### Human Rights Grievance Channel\\n\\nAmorepacific Group operates an Ethics Hotline channel in\\nKorean, English, and Chinese, where any unethical behaviors\\nor violation of human rights can be reported.

The identified vulnerable areas\\nare improved through specific corrective actions, and relevant\\npersonnel in the field and external experts are deployed to\\nsupport the implementation of remedial actions. The human\\nrights due diligence in 2022 was conducted through written\\nsurveys (in Korean and English) and pre-planned on-site due\\ndiligence. As a result of the due diligence, one issue related to\\nsexual/work harassment at workplace was identified through\\nthe reporting channel, so corrective action was taken.

We continue to monitor, evaluate, and improve\\nSHE performance through self-audit of the business sites using\\nSHE Standard, cross-audit of the business sites, and third-party\\naudits through external specialized institutions.\\n\\nIn particular, in order to respond to the Serious Accident\\nPunishment Act, which took effect in 2022, we developed a\\nchecklist consisting of 713 items for 32 laws related to safety and\\nhealth. Based on this, we conduct legal compliance inspections\\nonce every six months for all workplaces and make necessary\\nimprovements. Additionally, we are striving to create a safe\\nworkplace by conducting field-oriented third-party diagnosis\\nthrough external specialized institutions, including precise\\ndiagnosis of rules on industrial safety and health standards and\\ninspection of fire prevention and firefighting facilities.\\n\\n\\n#### Deriving Harmful or Dangerous Factors at Workplaces and Strengthening Improvement Activities\\n\\nAmorepacific conducts on-site risk diagnosis in consultation\\nwith external experts every year.

In order to assess and manage potential\\nESG risks for our suppliers, we are conducting business\\nwith suppliers who meet the minimum sustainability\\nrequirements when signing contracts. We evaluate\\nnew and existing suppliers on sustainable management\\nindicators such as quality, product safety, human rights,\\nsafety and health, and environment, and carefully identify\\nrisks and determine contractual relationships based on the\\nresults.\\n\\nAdditionally, regular annual sustainability assessments are\\nconducted for suppliers of a certain size or larger, including\\nsignificant suppliers, and the results are reflected in the\\ncomprehensive evaluation of suppliers with a weightage\\nof 10%. The five areas, human rights, safety and health,\\nenvironment, business ethics, and management system\\nare evaluated using checklists that apply international\\nstandards such as the RBA1) Code of Conduct, and OECD2)\\nGuidelines for Corporate Due Diligence. Based on the results\\nof the comprehensive evaluation, excellent suppliers are\\nprovided with incentives such as priority support for shared\\ngrowth programs, priority allocation of transactions, and\\nawards.\\n\\nIn the last three years, a total of 119 suppliers received\\nsustainability assessments from a third-party independent\\norganization, and the 2022 sustainability assessment\\nshowed areas of improvement for all target suppliers.\\nWe expect all suppliers who received a certain level of\\nrating or have been found with serious violations, to adopt\\nplans and measures for improvement. In particular, we\\ncheck whether the improvement action has been taken\\nfor significant suppliers. We also plan to provide support\\nprograms when suppliers need to improve ESG capabilities,\\n\\nand will adopt follow-up measures such as reducing and\\nlimiting transactions if ratings below a certain level persist.\\nMeanwhile, financial risks are managed by conducting\\nseparate credit ratings for all suppliers, and for secondary\\nsignificant suppliers, we carry out suveys to identify\\npotential risks in transactions.\\n\\nSupplier Sustainability Assessment Process\\n\\nPreparation for Assessment\\n\\n· Update assessment indicators\\n\\nSelection of suppliers to be evaluated\\n\\nî\\n\\nDesk Assessment\\n\\n· Utilizing online platform (self-assessment)\\n\\nÎ\\n\\nStatus Check\\n\\n· Conducting on-site assessment for high-risk suppliers\\n(Performed by specialized third-party organization)\\n\\nÎ\\n\\nDerive Results\\n\\n· Identifying risks and deriving improvement tasks for\\neach supplier\\n\\nT\\n\\nFollow-up Measures\\n\\nRequest for corrective actions and confirmation of\\ncorrective plans\\n\\nDistributing results reports\\n\\nResults of Supplier Sustainability Assessment\\n\\n\\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Category</td>\\n<td>2020</td>\\n<td>2021</td>\\n<td>2022</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Ratio of new suppliers that received sustainability assessment in the past three years (%)</td>\\n<td>100</td>\\n<td>100</td>\\n<td>100</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Ratio of significant suppliers that</td>\\n<td>100</td>\\n<td>100</td>\\n<td>100</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>\\n\\n\\nreceived sustainability assessment in\\nthe past three years (%)\\n\\n\\n<table>\\n<caption>Status of Corrective Action Taken for High-risk Significant Suppliers</caption>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Category</th>\\n<th>2020</th>\\n<th>2021</th>\\n<th>2022</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Number of high-risk significant suppliers</td>\\n<td>3</td>\\n<td>1</td>\\n<td>0</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rate of requests for corrective action (%)</td>\\n<td>100</td>\\n<td>100</td>\\n<td>-</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rate of established corrective action plan (%)</td>\\n<td>100</td>\\n<td>100</td>\\n<td>-</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rate of completion of corrective action</td>\\n<td>100</td>\\n<td>100</td>\\n<td>-</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>\\n\\n\\n(%)\\n\\n1\\\\) RBA(Responsible Business Alliance)\\n\\n2\\\\) OECD(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development)\\n\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Chapter 1\" -->\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Chapter 2\" -->\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Chapter 3.

Since 2008,\\nAmorepacific Group has completely discontinued conducting\\nanimal testing on its own, and since 2013, it has implemented\\na total ban on animal testing, including all its partner\\ncompanies.\\n\\nIn order to evaluate cosmetics raw materials and products\\naccurately, Amorepacific Group utilizes credible testing\\nmethods such as OECD guidelines and certified tests from the\\nEuropean Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods\\n(ECVAM) and in-house methods developed based on scientific\\ntheory.\\n\\nIn particular, the research and development capabilities behind\\nour own animal replacement test method have resulted in\\n59 domestic and international research papers, 15 patents1).\\nAdditionally we actively engage in many international joint\\nstudies and consistently present academic achievements at\\nglobal toxicology conferences in the United States, Europe,\\nand other regions. Recently, we initiated research into next-\\ngeneration animal replacement testing methods such as\\nmicrodevice-based 3D hybrid artificial tissue, which mimics\\nhuman organs and blood vessels, allowing us to assess the\\nimpact on skin tissue and organs based on material flow,\\nskin penetration prediction program and comprehensive\\nconstruction of database.\\n\\n\\n## Research on Sensitive Skin\\n\\nAmorepacific Group has been steadily studying the\\ncharacteristics of sensitive skin since the launch of the\\nbrand Soonjung, a brand specializing in sensitive skin,\\nin 1988. We have established the base for research on\\nsensitive skin through collaboration with outstanding\\nhospitals in Korea. We further strengthened Amorepacific\\'s\\nproprietary sensitive skin evaluation system through\\nresearch on skin characteristics in Korea, China, the US, EU\\nand South East Asia, the characteristics of the microbiome\\nof sensitive skin, and diagnosing sensitive skin based on\\ngene polymorphism. Moreover, to better understand and\\naddress customer concerns related to specific area like the\\nscalp, eyes, and lips as well as skin, we are expanding the\\nscope of our research. We are providing customers with\\nmore in-depth and personalized solutions for sensitive skin,\\nstriving to offer the best possible outcomes.\\n\\n\\n## Strengthening Production Quality\\n\\nThe cosmetics manufacturing process requires extreme\\nprecision, as even the slightest differences can have a\\ntremendous impact on the quality of the final product. To\\nminimize variability in results and maximize product quality,\\nwe have developed the technology to predict the direction\\nand speed of formula movement. Since 2012, we have\\nanalyzed countless flow patterns and made modifications\\nto the production processes and structures of our facilities.\\nWe have gone a step further by using this data to build\\nfacilities with layouts and structures customized to particular\\ncosmetics formulations - a manufacturing innovation unique\\nto Amorepacific.\\n\\nWith the goal of standardizing quality across our production\\nfacilities, we have integrated IT and manufacturing\\ntechnologies to create the Recipe Control System (RCS)\\nthat regulates the entire cosmetics manufacturing process.\\nOur RCS has enabled us to eliminate human error from the\\nmanufacturing process, thereby minimizing deviations in\\nquality and enabling us to continue delivering the healthiest,\\nsafest, and the most effective products to our customers.\\n\\nIn addition, we strengthened the safe production system\\nby establishing a bulk tracking system. IoT (Internet of\\nThings) infrastructure has been integrated to the bulk\\nstorage container, a tool for storing manufactured bulk to be\\ntransported to the storage and then to the packaging line, to\\nenable automatic cleaning and management of the storage\\ncontainer. Moreover, we established cleaning expiration dates\\nbased on microbiologival tests and introduced a Fool Proof\\nfunction, ensuring that storage containers beyond the cleaning\\ndate are rendered unusable.\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"1) Papers and patents as of December 2022\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n<!-- PageNumber=\"óĺ\" -->\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Chapter 1\" -->\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Chapter 2 Chapter 3.

In other words, they are unpredictable and can cause significant human and material damage and loss when they occurs.</td>\\n<td>Amorepacific Group has established plans and processes to prepare for incidents and accidents</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>caused by such unpredictable disasters and natural disasters. Additionally, safety regulations have been put in place to prevent such incidents, and relevant training is provided to employees. To minimize physical and human damages and respond quickly in the event of unpredictable incidents and accidents, an organization dedicated to safety integration (Safety and Health Center) has been designated and the role of each department has been reestablished. In this way, we plan to improve and expand measures for the safety of our members.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Increased Export Costs Due to the Adoption of Carbon Border Tax by Country</td>\\n<td>Environment</td>\\n<td>The EU countries are in the process of adopting carbon border tax system that requires the purchase of carbon emission rights, similar to taxes, for carbon emissions generated during the production process. According to the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, if the EU imposes a carbon border tax of about $36 per ton of carbon dioxide, it is expected that Korea will incur an additional tax burden of $1 billion or more annually. As of 2022, Amorepacific Group exports products to numerous countries in Asia, Europe, and North America, raising concerns about deterioration in price competitiveness due to increased production and export costs when this carbon border tax is applied. that price competitiveness may worsen due to increased costs of production and export when this carbon border tax is applied.</td>\\n<td>In order to proactively address climate crisis-related regulations in areas like the EU, Amorepacific Group has strengthened its environmental assessment for its products. Furthermore, we measure the environmental footprint of each product and have developed and adopted low-carbon technologies to reduce the environmental impact of each product. Amorepacific Group was the first Korean company to participate in the EcoBeautyScore Consortium since 2021, a group made up of global cosmetics companies and professional associations, jointly working on developing environmental assessment methods and scoring systems for cosmetics.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Disruptions in the Global Supply Chain Due to Conflicts between Countries</td>\\n<td>Social</td>\\n<td>The global supply chains are intricately intertwined, and any disruptions in specific supply chains due to conflicts between countries can significantly impact corporate management. Delays in customs clearance may occur if the import of raw materials is affected by inter-country conflicts, particularly when a high proportion of raw materials are imported from a specific country. Amorepacific Group imports raw materials and packaging materials from diverse supply chains, and it anticipates a considerable negative impact on its profits and losses if production and distribution within these supply chains face disruptions.</td>\\n<td>To resolve issues arising from conflicts between countries, Amorepacific Group monitors quantitative market indicators at all times. In doing so, we are securing our price competitiveness as we respond to changes in supply and demand by increasing our reserve inventory levels for raw materials. In addition, we are seeking to diversify our supply chain for raw materials by adapting to the global situation. To minimize potential risks related to raw material supply chains, we manage and identify items that could be subject to regulations and their associated risks by manufacturer, as well as monitor trends among countries.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Changes in the population structure leading to shifts in market customers</td>\\n<td>Social</td>\\n<td>Korea is experiencing rapid demographic changes due to the acceleration of low birth rates and an aging population. These demographic changes may lead to a decrease in the natural population and the working-age population, posing a potential risk of low growth in the future. In the case of Japanese market, which has already entered an aging society, both the overall sales volume and amount of shampoo sales have been decreasing gradually over the past decade. In response to these demographic changes, such as a decrease in the economically active population and an aging population, and customer changes such as an increase in single-person households and active seniors, Amorepacific Group needs to come up with new business models and respond proactively to the issues.</td>\\n<td>Amorepacific Group is making efforts to enhance its business competitiveness in markets where low birth rates, aging populations, and population decline are expected to intensify. We are also developing highly functional innovative products for active senior consumers and accelerating research on the development of customized cosmetics and health functional foods that take into account individual skin and health conditions as well as individual preferences.</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>\\n\\n\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"n E Chapter 1 Chapter 2\" -->\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Chapter 3.

Furthermore, we continue to monitor the results of evaluations by internationally trusted institutions such as CCS, CIR, EFSA,\\nand IARC. The Group operates a process to discern the safe of products by evaluating human and environmental impacts when introducing new substances Also, the MSDS\\n(Material Safety Data Sheet) of all chemicals used by the Group is managed through the Amorepacific Group Chemicals Integrated Management System (AP-CHEMS).\\n\\nCG-HP-\\n250a.4\\n\\nRevenue from products designed with green chemistry\\nprinciples\\n\\nPackaging\\nLifecycle\\n\\nCG-HP-\\n(1) Total weight of packaging\\n\\n410a.1\\n\\n(2) Percentage made from recycled and/or renewable materials\\n\\nManagement\\n\\n(3) Percentage that is recyclable, reusable, and/or compostable\\n\\n47.1%\\n\\nCG-HP-\\n410a.2\\n\\nDiscussion of strategies to reduce the environmental impact of\\npackaging throughout its lifecycle\\n\\nThe 4RReduce, Recycle, Reuse, Return strategies were established for packaging materials to create a plastic circulation model by reducing the use of unnecessary plastic\\npackaging materials, improving recyclability, reusing and returning containers throughout the product\\'s lifecycle. To implement the strategy, the goal of designing 100%\\nplastic packaging materials to be recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2030, and applying recycled or bioplastics to 30% of plastic packaging materials, was included in\\nthe fourth promise of 2030 A MORE Beautiful Promise. Furthermore, brand-level Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have been established to track the progress, and the\\nenvironmental impact of packaging materials is closely managed to ensure efficient use of packaging raw materials.\\n\\nEnvironmental &\\n\\nSocial Impacts of\\nPalm Oil Supply\\n\\nChain\\n\\nCG-HP-\\nAmount of palm oil sourced, percentage certified through the\\n430a.1\\nRoundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) supply chains as\\n(a) Identity Preserved, (b) Segregated, (c) Mass Balance, or (d)\\nBook & Claim\\n\\nApproximately 20,145 tonnes of palm-derived raw materials were sourced in 2022, with a 53.6% ratio of RSPO MB (Mass Balance) certified palm oil.\\n\\n1\\\\) The purpose of regulations such as DTSC\\'s Candidate Chemical List, EU REACH/CLP regulations, and domestic chemical evaluation laws like the Chemical Substance Registration and Evaluation Act, and Chemical Substance Control Act, is the same. They aim to\\nassess and manage chemical substances based on similar risk criteria. Given that the domestic chemical evaluation laws in Korea have benchmarked EU REACH, one of the key standards for DTSC\\'s Candide Chemical List, we consider the domestic regulations to\\nbe equivalent to the DTSC\\'s Candidate Chemical List.\\n\\nSASB Index\\n\\n\\n#### Activity Indicators\\n\\n\\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Topic</th>\\n<th>Code</th>\\n<th>Accounting Metric</th>\\n<th>Description</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Activity</td>\\n<td>CG-</td>\\n<td>Units of products</td>\\n<td>As Amorepacific Group</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Indicators</td>\\n<td>HP-000.A</td>\\n<td>sold, total weight of products sold</td>\\n<td>has a wide variety of product portfolio, information about the unit and total weight of products sold is not disclosed.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td rowspan=\"2\"></td>\\n<td>CG-</td>\\n<td>Number of</td>\\n<td>5 (Amore Beauty Park,</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>HP-000.B</td>\\n<td>manufacturing facilities</td>\\n<td>Daily Beauty production site, OSULLOC production site, Healthcare production site, Shanghai production plant)</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>\\n\\n\\nEnvironmental,\\n\\nHealth,\\n\\nOnly substances and raw materials that meet the criteria for safe cosmetics are selectively chosen and used, adhering to domestic regulations, such as the \\'Chemical\\nRegistration and Evaluation Act\\' and \\'Chemical Control Act\\'.

We planned and performed our work so\\nas to obtain all the information and explanations deemed\\nnecessary to provide us with sufficient evidence to provide\\na verification opinion with 5% materiality level, concerning\\nthe completeness of the emission inventory as well as the\\nreported emission figures in ton CO2 equivalent. As part of the\\nverification process;\\n\\n. We have reviewed and verified the Greenhouse Gas Inventory\\nReport of AMOREPACIFIC Group (including activity data,\\nGHG emission calculation results, emission factors, and other\\nparameters)\\n\\n. We have reviewed and verified the process to generate,\\naggregate and report the emissions data\\n\\n\\n###### Conclusions\\n\\nBased on the above verification of core elements, it is the\\nDNV\\'s opinion that nothing comes to our attention to\\nsuggest that GHG emissions are not properly calculated, and\\na significant uncertainty and error are included in the GHG\\nEmissions from domestic sites of AMOREPACIFIC Group for\\n2020-2022 below;\\n\\n\\n## Greenhouse Gas Emissions of AMOREPACIFIC Group\\n\\n2020-2022\\n\\nGHG Emissions\\n(tCO2-eq)\\n\\nScope 1\\n\\nRefer to the\\nattachment # 1,2\\n\\nScope 2\\n\\nScope3\\n\\nTotal (Scope 1,2)\\n\\nTotal (Scope 1,2,3)\\n\\nEnergy Consumption (GJ)\\n\\nFuel\\n\\nElectricity\\n\\nRenewable Energy\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n8th May 2023\\nDNV Business Assurance Korea\\nCountry Representative Lee, Jang Sup\\n\\n\\n<figure>\\n\\n16\\\\. com\\n\\nJ.S.\\n\\n</figure>\\n\\n\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n<!-- PageNumber=\"112\" -->\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"GRI Content Index | SASB Index | TCFD Index | Verification Statement GHG Inventory | Independent Assurance Statement\" -->\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Chapter 5.

    "**Markdown** is a structured and formatted markup language and a popular input for enabling semantic chunking in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). You can use the Markdown content from the Layout model to split documents based on paragraph boundaries, create specific chunks for tables, and fine-tune your chunking strategy to improve the quality of the generated responses.\n",
